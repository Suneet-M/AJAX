# Ajax
This repo was given to students in the Udactiy Front-End Nanodegree course. We were given outline HTML and CSS files and had to implement Ajax using different methods.\
The project is a simple search query app.\
The query searched for, will display an image relating to it and then news articles for that query.\
The images are fetched using [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).\
Articles are fetched using [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com/).

## Udacity repo README
This is the [repo](https://github.com/udacity/course-ajax) for Udacity's Ajax course. The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

* the XHR object
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method
* the Fetch API

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.
